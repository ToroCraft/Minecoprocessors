Increase your redstone possibilities and learn assembly programming at the same time with the Minecoprocessors Minecraft Mod! The Minecoprocessors Mod adds a redstone processor block that can be programed similar to a real microprocessor.  The redstone processor block is styled to look and operate like the other redstone blocks in the game.
